## What is Babylon ?

Babylon is a `CLI[^1]` principally targeted at Devops users of the Cosmo Tech Platform.  
It allows the user to interact with the multiple systems used in the platform, performing multiple operations in a simple and streamlined fashion.

Instead of requiring the user to learn how to use numerous software to interact with the systems, Babylon allows you to learn a single format.

## Why Babylon ?

Babylon was developed to help users getting around the difficulty of juggling around with multiple softwares to interact with the multiple systems composing the Cosmo Tech Platform.

By using Babylon you only need one single software to work on your multiple needs.

The team behind Babylon is closely tied to the one working on the Cosmo Tech Platform, and new features of the platform can quickly be added to Babylon allowing users to get fast access to the newest content.


## ðŸ¤” Still not convinced ?

!!! question "Why should you care"
    **Babylon is more than a CLI it's a framework**  
    It not only gives you access to **low-level commands** (direct interaction with a single system),  
    but also provides **high-level commands** that allow **automation of entire processes**.  

    This reduces the risk of human errors.  
    This saves time when dealing with complex workflows.  

### ðŸ”‘ Macro Commands

!!! example "Automation made simple"
    Babylon introduces `Macro Commands[^2]`:  
    combinations of low-level commands bundled into **one simple instruction**.  

    ðŸ‘‰ With Macro Commands, you can automate complex operations in a **safer** and **faster** way.

# Discover Babylon

## What is Babylon ?

Babylon is a CLI[^1] principally targeted at Devops users of the Cosmotech Platform.  
It allows user to interact with the multiple systems used in the platform, performing multiple operations in a simple and streamlined fashion.

Instead of requiring the user to learn how to use numerous software to interact with the systems, Babylon allow you to learn a single format.

## Why Babylon ?

Babylon was developed to help users getting around the difficulty of juggling around with multiple software to interact with the multiple systems composing the Cosmotech Platform.

By using Babylon you only need one single software to work on your multiple needs.

The team behind Babylon is closely tied to the one working on the Cosmotech Platform, and new features of the platform can quickly be added to Babylon allowing users to get fast access to the newest content.

## I'm still not convinced

Well, Babylon comes as a full framework allowing its developers to make simpler commands for you. While you get access to low level commands that directly interact with a single system, you also get high level commands allowing you a full automation of processes and such reducing the risk of errors between elements.

Such commands are called `Macro Commands`[^2] and allow a full automation of possibly complex processes.

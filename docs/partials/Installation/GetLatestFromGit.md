You can download the latest version of Babylon using git with the following command
???+ example "Get sources from git"
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:Cosmo-Tech/Babylon.git Babylon-Sources
    ```

You now have a folder called `Babylon-Sources` which we will refer to as "Babylon Installation Folder" for the rest of the guide

If you want a specific version of Babylon you can check which version number you want (for example `1.2.0`) and to the following

???+ example "Change the source version from git"
    ```bash
    cd Babylon-Source
    git checkout 1.2.0
    ```

Now your installation folder will have the code of the version `1.2.0` ready to be used

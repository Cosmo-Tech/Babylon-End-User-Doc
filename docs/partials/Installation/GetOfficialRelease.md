So you choose to use releases, very well, 
go on the following page to get one of the releases  
[![Releases](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Releases-informational?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/Cosmo-Tech/Babylon/releases)

Then you can select a type of compressed folder you want (`.zip` or `.tar.gz`) and download the file.

Now you can decompress the file you downloaded.

???+ example "Decompress a file"
    === "zip"
        ```bash
        unzip Babylon-1.2.0.zip
        ```
    === "tar.gz"
        ```bash
        tar -xf Babylon-1.2.0.tar.gz
        ```
After run you now have a folder named `Babylon-1.2.0` which we will refer to as "Babylon Installation Folder" for the rest of the guide

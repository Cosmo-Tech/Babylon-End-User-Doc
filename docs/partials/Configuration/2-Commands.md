Just like the `edit` and `set-variable` commands you can use the `create` commands between platform/deployment configuration.

???+ example "`create` command"
    ```bash
    babylon config platform create NewPlatform
    ```
    This command will create a new platform file called NewPlatform in your configuration folder

???+ example "Use of the `select` command"
    ![Platform select gif](../assets/Platform_Select.gif)

    You can see that we selected the platform NewPlatform and after the selection, the correct element was selected.

You can start by taking a look at some of the first commands you could run in Babylon

=== "Simple commands"
    ```bash
    # You can start by looking at the basic help
    babylon --help
    # Next you can take a look at the version of babylon you installed
    babylon --version
    # Now you can look at the state of your configuration
    babylon config display
    ```

As you can see in the final command, your current configuration has a lot of keys defined but most of them are empty.

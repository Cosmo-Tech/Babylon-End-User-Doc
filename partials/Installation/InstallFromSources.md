## Get Babylon sources

We will go through the process of getting a version of Babylon before the installation.

You can make your choice on how you may want to process :

=== "Get official releases"
    --8<-- 'partials/Installation/GetOfficialRelease.md'

=== "Use latest version from git"
    --8<-- 'partials/Installation/GetLatestFromGit.md'
